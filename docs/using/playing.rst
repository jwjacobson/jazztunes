Playing tunes
=============

You can 'play' tunes by clicking the **play** button on the homepage, or by using the **Play** page, accessed from the navbar.

The **Play** page will recommend a tune to play based on your search results (see XX for more on searching). It will not suggest tunes with a Learning value of "don't know." If you submit an empty search if will use your whole repertoire (except the ones you don't know).

Regularly updating your plays is the most useful feature of the app!
