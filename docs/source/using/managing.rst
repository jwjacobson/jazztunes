Managing tunes
==============
You can manage your tunes on the **Home** page, accessed by clicking **jazztunes** on the left side of the navbar or the **Home** button on the right side.

Press the ``Edit`` button to edit a tune and the ``Delete`` button to delete it.

.. warning:: There is no way to undelete a tune!

You can also sort tunes by column by clicking the column name. Use shift-click to sort by multiple columns.

.. note:: Sorting tunes by ``Last Played`` is a great way to see what tunes you've been playing recently!
