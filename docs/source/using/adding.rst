Adding tunes
===============
There are two ways to add tunes to your repertoire: creating them manually or taking them from the public repertoire.

Creating tunes manually
-----------------------
To create a tune, click the **create** button on the navbar, then fill in the form with the info you want to include. Title is the only required field. To learn more about the different fields, see :ref:`tune_fields`.

Taking tunes
-------------
The public repertoire contains approximately 200 common tunes. Access it by clicking the **public** button on the navbar.
To add a tune, click the **take** button. The tune will immediately enter your repertoire, and you will have the option of setting when you last played the tune, your knowledge of it, and any tags.
