Adding tunes
===============
There are two ways to add tunes to your repertoire: creating them manually or taking them from the public repertoire.

Creating tunes manually
-----------------------
To create a tune, click the **Add** button on the navbar, then fill in the form with the info you want to include. Title is the only required field. To learn more about the different fields, see :ref:`tune_fields`.

Taking tunes
-------------
The public repertoire contains approximately 200 common tunes. Access it by clicking the **Browse** button on the navbar.
To add a tune, click the **Take** button. The tune will immediately enter your repertoire, and you will be given the additional option of setting when you last played the tune, your knowledge of it, and any tags. Press the **Set** button to set them.
