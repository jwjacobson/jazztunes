Playing tunes
=============

You can 'play' tunes by clicking the ``Play`` button on the homepage, or by using the **Play** page, accessed from the navbar. 'Playing' a tune increases the Play count by 1 and updates the Last Played value of the tune to now.

The **Play** page will recommend a tune to play based on your search results; the goal is to help avoid the choice paralysis of "What tune should I play?" It will not suggest tunes with a Knowledge value of "don't know." See :ref:`searching` for more information on how search works.

.. note:: The more consistently you update your plays, the more useful the app will be!
