Tune analytics
===============
To access tune analytics, click the **Analytics** button on the navbar.

At present, only three aspects of a user's playing are displayed: most played tunes, least played tunes, and total plays by style, jazz vs. standard. At a glace you get a sense of the overall composition of your repertoire as well as favored and less-favored tunes.


You can use the dropdown menus to select timespan and the number of tunes to include.
