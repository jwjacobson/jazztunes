Planned features
=================

These are not-yet-implemented features of the app.

Custom tags
------------

The user should be able to create their own tags instead of just selecting from precreated ones.

Custom analytics
-----------------

The user should be able to visualize any query supported by the data, not just the current most played, least played, and jazz vs. standard breakdowns.

Multiple keys
--------------

There should be a way to track playing a tune in multiple keys. For now, the best way to do this is to create multiple tunes with the same title, one for each key.
