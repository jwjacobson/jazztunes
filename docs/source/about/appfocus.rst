App focus: what jazztunes is *not*
======================================

Inspired by the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well", the focus of this app is repertoire management. It is not a general practice app, and it is not a tune *learning* app. Jazztunes assumes the user already has access to the materials they need to learn a tune â€” recordings, lead sheets, etc. What it offers is easy and intuitive access to all tunes known by the user, filtered and sorted by any desired criteria.
