App focus, or what jazztunes is *not*
======================================

Inspired by the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well", the focus of this app is repertoire management. It is not a general practice app, and it is not a tune *learning* app. There are other resources that fulfill those functions. Jazztunes assumes the user has access to the materials they need to learn a tune (recordings, sheet music, etc.) outside of the app itself. What it offers is easy and intuitive access to all tunes known by the user, filtered and sorted by any desired criteria.
