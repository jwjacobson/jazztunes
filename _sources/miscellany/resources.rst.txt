Resources
==========

Here you'll find links to useful jazz resources on the web.

`Ethan Iverson's site <https://ethaniverson.com/>_`
    Contains Ethan's thoughts on jazz as well as interviews with other musicians, transcriptions, and historical deep dives. I've filled a lot of gaps in my jazz history knowledge via this site. His `list of 100 standards <https://ethaniverson.com/a-new-meaning-old-approach-to-jazz-education/>_` was the initial basis for Jazztunes' public repertoire.

`Jazz Guitar Comprehensive <https://www.jazzguitarcomprehensive.com/>_`
    In particular, the `Repertoire <https://www.jazzguitarcomprehensive.com/tableofcontents>_` section contains the most in-depth public analysis and discussion of standards that I've found, including what constitutes "common practice" among musicians today. Provides free lead sheets with chords but no melody. The playalongs are also a lot of fun! 

`Jazzstandards.com <https://www.jazzstandards.com/index.html>_`
    Venerable site with lots of historical info on a large number of standards.

`iReal Pro jazz standards <https://github.com/mikeoliphant/JazzStandards>_`
    Has lots of jazz standard info in JSON format.
