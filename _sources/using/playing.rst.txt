Playing tunes
=============

You can 'play' tunes by clicking the **play** button on the homepage, or by using the **Play** page, accessed from the navbar.

The **Play** page will recommend a tune to play based on your search results. It will not suggest tunes with a Knowledge value of "don't know." If you submit an empty search if will use your whole repertoire (except the ones you don't know).

The more consistently you update your plays, the more useful the app will be.
